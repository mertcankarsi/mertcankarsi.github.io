I purchased my NuPhy Air75 keyboard in the first quarter of 2022. Since the day I got it, I’ve used this keyboard as my daily driver. I loved this keyboard so much that my other keyboards were left out in the cold.

After two years, the battery life has significantly decreased, and now I have to charge it almost every other day. I should have realized then that there was a problem with the battery.

Yesterday, while cleaning my desk and keyboard, I noticed a gap in the keyboard casing.

Ta-da! I now have a `spicy pillow`!

When I googled this situation a bit, I found that nearly all users experience this problem after a certain number of charge cycles. There are users who claim that NuPhy uses low-quality batteries and doesn’t include overcharge protection.

Check out the [link][google-search] to see similar situations...

I’m planning to remove the battery and use it only with a wired connection because I’m afraid of the battery catching fire. At least until my new battery order arrives...

I will update this blog post...
